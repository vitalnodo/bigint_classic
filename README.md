# bigint classic
An attempt to implement classic bigint library.
Currently supported operations:
* set hex
* get hex
* bitwise not, xor, or, and
* bitwise shift left, shift right
* addition
* subtraction
* multiplication
* baby division and modulo o_O
* comparison

There are also fun colored tests if any operation is poorly implemented.

Planned:
* codereview
* normal modulo
* normal division
* modular exponentiation (Montgomery reduction?)
