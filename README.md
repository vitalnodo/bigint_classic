# bigint classic
An attempt to implement classic bigint library. One can choose any limb (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t, uint64). Currently supported operations:
* set hex
* get hex
* bitwise not, xor, or, and
* bitwise shift left, shift right
* addition
* subtraction
* comparison

There are also fun colored tests if any operation is poorly implemented.

Planned:
* codereview
* multiplication
* modulo
* division
* modular exponentiation
